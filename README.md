The plan is for two of these jet units in conjunction with two 3000w brushless motors to be used together to power an electric surfboard. The project is currently in the early design phase.

Designed to be printed in HIPS (although ABS and PLA could also be used) on a 180 mm x 180 mm x 110 mm print area, and then smoothed with limonene - acetone should work for ABS but PLA has no solvent that I'm aware of. Gluing some components such as the fairings could also be an issue with PLA but I believe there are some glues out there that work with it.
