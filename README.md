# openwaterjet
Open-source 3D-printable waterjet for small-scale applications. 

## Licensing
The OpenSCAD components are licensed under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license - see COPYING. When I get round to writing software to control things, that will likely be licensed under GPLv3 unless I change my mind.

## Making
The plan is for two of these jet units in conjunction with two 3000w brushless motors to be used together to power an electric surfboard. The project is currently in the early design phase.

Designed to be printed in HIPS (although ABS and PLA could also be used) on a 180 mm x 180 mm x 110 mm print area, and then smoothed with limonene - acetone should work for ABS but PLA has no solvent that I'm aware of. Gluing some components such as the fairings could also be an issue with PLA but I believe there are some glues out there that work with it.

## This Repo
There is a bill of materials which lists the required components for the project, and also whole.scad, which shows how the plastic components fit together.
