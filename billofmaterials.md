# Bill of Materials

This Bill of Materials is incomplete at the moment and is designed to give a vague indication of the parts I intend to use. As I haven't actually built this yet, I can't guarantee the parts mentioned here work as intended with this setup. This project has been designed to allow for the use of any number of jet drive units next to each other, so parts are divided in to per drive unit and per whole setup. It is possible for both clockwise and anticlockwise propellers to be used if the nozzle is reflected when printing, since the stators are directional in this part.

## For Jet Units alone
### 3D Printed components from this repository
#### Per Whole Setup
* 2 x **fairings.scad**, one reflected
#### Per Drive Unit
* optional - 1 x **batterybox.scad** - for using pairs of 3s 5000 mAh batteries
* 1 x **motormount.scad**
* 1 x front half of **intake.scad** - see file for details on how to select halves
* 1 x rear half of **intake.scad**
* 1 x **propspace.scad**
* 1 x **nozzle.scad** - reflect based on direction of propeller rotation
### Electrical components
#### Per Whole Setup
* 1 x **6S LiPo Battery** of your choice, 5000 mAh per drive unit and upwards recommended
  * Example: [Multistar High Capacity 20000mAh 6S 10C Multi-Rotor Lipo Pack](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/multistar-high-capacity-6s-20000mah-multi-rotor-lipo-pack.html)
* 1 x **LiPo charger**, of your choice, must be suitable for battery voltage
#### Per Drive Unit
