# Bill of Materials

This Bill of Materials is incomplete at the moment and is designed to give a vague indication of the parts I intend to use. As I haven't actually built this yet, I can't guarantee the parts mentioned here work as intended with this setup. This project has been designed to allow for the use of any number of jet drive units next to each other, so parts are divided in to per drive unit and per whole setup. It is possible for both clockwise and anticlockwise propellers to be used if the nozzle is reflected when printing, since the stators are directional in this part. Links are mostly for UK suppliers, other local suppliers may be available for other countries.

## For Jet Units alone
